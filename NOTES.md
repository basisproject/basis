- equations
  - ProductivityRate: determines a person's productivity
    - based on industry average (ranges from -0.5 to 0.5, 0 being average)
    - NOTE: this would be HEAVILY per-industry influenced and nuanced
      - ex: can a dr's productivity be measured by "patients per hour"?
        - would incentivize bad behavior
      - programmers were measured in the past by lines of code
    - might need to be based on mutual workplace agreements and quarterly peer evaluation
  - CostOfUnskilledLabor (no education needed):
    - (IndustryHours * ProductivityRate)
  - CostOfSkilledLabor: (WIP) needs to account for cost of education
    - (IndustryHours * ProductivityRate) + (CostOfEducation / years productive)
      - obviously, new recruits are the most expensive (is this right?)
  - CostOfEducation:
    - TeacherHours + (Mainenance / TotalStudents)
      - TeacherHours:
        - for each teacher
          - CostOfSkilledLabor * (hours spent with student)
      - Maintenance:
        - for each enrolled hour (eg, 4 years would be 365 * 24 * 4 = 35040)
          - labor hours (skilled or unskilled) of all maintenance staff
            - janitorial
            - electrician
            - IT
      - TotalStudents:
        - on any given day, how many students are enrolled
  - Salary:
    - salary = IndustryHours * ProductivityRate * (0.5 + EducationVesting)
      - IndustryHours: (hours worked) * StressIndex * SocialNeed
        - StressIndex: mental + physical stress
          - possibly determined per-region
        - SocialNeed: NEED teachers. NEED construction. we don't NEED dildos (well, i do, most people don't)
          - possibly determined per-region
      - EducationVesting: Min(IndustryYearsWorking / EducationLaborCost, 1)
        - incentivizes people to not switch industries until they have "payed back" their education
    
- is currency used?
  - yes
  - currency is a measure of work done
  - stored electronically, all transactions go through conductor
    - the idea is to make it difficult/expensive to make secondary markets
- how is global trade operated?
  - trade "companies" buy foreign products at the exchange rate of the currency
  - the "cost" of the products (to society, not the price sold) is the exact $$ amount used to purchase
    - foreign exchanges have exchange rates set (per-currency or across the board) via planning
- federate on the company level? or region level?
  - probably region (city/municipality), right?
- need to model balancing
  - conductor acts as regional/country-wide market
  - companies buy products via conductor
    - arrange shipment via conductor
    - all market transactions happen via conductor
    - allows tracking the actual "cost" of the inputs
  - companies sell products at arbitrary prices
    - higher the price, the lower the chance of selling
      - incentivizes efficiency and competition between companies
    - higher prices allow a company to expand production
  - every good sold by a company can be traced back to its raw materials
    - optional?
- job markets
  - companies have listings on conductor for positions
  - companies interview and hire the best candidates
  - self-employment is an option
    - all transactions go through conductor
- production company modeling
  - determine is a company necessary?
    - don't need 500 dildo companies, probably
    - who decides to start a company?
      - incentives for starting a productive company?
    - measure company output?
      - speaks to currency. if company is too expensive to run, close it
  - company outputs:
    - consumer products
      - tvs
      - cars
        - sports cars?
          - speaks to currency
      - surfboards (ie, hobby markets)
    - essentials
      - food
      - construction
  - company inputs:
    - request 10 widgets, conductor matches to a widget-making company
  - global federated market to request *consumer* goods (ie, Communazon)
    - detect fraud? people can order 100 dildos when they only need 1
      - good use for currency!
- workforce
  - salary = IndustryHours * ProductivityRate * (0.5 + EducationVesting)
    - IndustryHours: (hours worked) * (mental/physical stress) * (societal need)
    - ProductivityRate: based on industry average (ranges from -0.5 to 0.5, 0 being average)
    - EducationVesting: Min(IndustryYearsWorking / EducationLaborCost, 1)
      - incentivizes people to not switch industries until they have "payed back" their education
  - measure cost based not just on labor hours, but the societal cost of education
    - (CostOfEducation / years productive) * (IndustryHours * ProductivityRate)
      - CostOfEducation: factors in all the skilled/unskilled labor hours to educate
        - recursive? must have dampening to avoid infinite looping
      - given the above, new workers are MUCH more expensive to society than old ones.
        - perhaps this should be taken into account in salary for *skilled workers*
    - EducationPayback: At some point a person has payed back their education completely?
      - at this point EducationVesting in salary equation should be 1
      - also at this point, if they are a teacher, CostOfEducation 
  - education cost per student
    - cost of teacher hours (skill
  - can't work (injury/brain condition/etc)
    - pay them low-level salary?
  - don't want to work
    - some acceptable buffer of non-productive population
      - EUTHENIZATION jkjkjk
      - SJW CUCKS
      - ??
- housing
  - is it "free" or does it take credits?
  - houses
    - obviously cost more than 1BR apartment (good use for currency)
  - houses for non-working?
    - probably, low end, or shelters with food (see "don't want to work")
